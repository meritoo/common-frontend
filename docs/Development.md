# Getting started

Build, create and start Docker's containers by running command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

# Install or remove package

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is used as package manager.

1. To install, add new package to project run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose run yarn add <package-name>
    ```

2. To uninstall, remove package from project run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose run yarn remove <package-name>
    ```
